# Save Indicator Improvement

## Problem
The "Saved" popup that appeared in the top-right corner was:
- Distracting and flashy
- Appeared frequently during auto-save
- Took up screen space
- Not very useful since auto-save is automatic
- No visual feedback when clicking the save button

## Solution
Replaced the popup with a subtle save icon in the editor header with visual feedback:

### New Save Button
- Located next to the copy button in the editor header
- Shows a save icon (floppy disk)
- When saving: Shows spinning loading ring
- When error: Icon turns red with error tooltip
- Clickable: User can manually trigger save
- Subtle: Doesn't interrupt workflow

### Features
- **Visual states**:
  - Normal: Gray save icon (floppy disk)
  - Saving: Spinning ring animation
  - Saved: Green checkmark (shows for 2 seconds)
  - Error: Red icon with error message in tooltip
  
- **Interactive**:
  - Click to manually save immediately
  - Bypasses auto-save delay
  - Shows checkmark feedback after save
  - Disabled when no project selected
  
- **Automatic feedback**:
  - Shows checkmark after auto-save too
  - Works for both manual and automatic saves
  - Checkmark fades back to save icon after 2 seconds
  
- **Unobtrusive**:
  - No popups or notifications
  - Lives in the header with other actions
  - Only visible when relevant
  - Subtle color changes (green for success)

## Implementation
- Removed floating save indicator popup
- Added save button before copy button
- Uses same styling as other header buttons
- Added `justSaved` state and `savedTimeoutRef` for checkmark timing
- Shows checkmark for 2 seconds after successful save
- Updates both `autoSaveProject()` and inline auto-save to set `justSaved`
- Three icon states: save icon → spinning ring → checkmark → save icon
- Green color for checkmark, red for errors, gray for normal
- Cleans up timeout on unmount

## User Experience
**Before:**
- Popup appears: "Saving..."
- Popup disappears
- Distracting flash every few seconds
- No feedback when clicking save button

**After:**
- Save icon shows spinning ring briefly while saving
- Changes to green checkmark when saved
- Checkmark visible for 2 seconds then fades back to save icon
- Works for both auto-save and manual save
- No popups or interruptions
- Can click to force save if needed
- Clear visual confirmation that save completed
- Error state clearly visible but not intrusive

## Files Modified
- `src/panel/panel.tsx` - Removed popup, added save button to header
