# Project Update Sync Fix

## Problem

When editing a project's title or description in the Projects modal and clicking "Save Changes", the changes were saved to storage but the current project state wasn't updated. This meant:

1. The title in the editor header didn't update
2. The project card showed old information until page reload
3. User had to reload the extension to see changes

## Root Cause

The `onProjectUpdate` callback in `ProjectManager` was calling `loadProjects()`, which only updated the `projects` array but didn't refresh the `currentProject` state if it was the one being edited.

```typescript
// Before: Only updates projects array
const loadProjects = useCallback(async () => {
  const loadedProjects = await StorageService.getProjects();
  setProjects(loadedProjects);
  // currentProject not updated!
}, []);
```

## Solution

Modified `loadProjects` to also refresh the `currentProject` if it exists in the updated projects list:

```typescript
// After: Updates both projects array and currentProject
const loadProjects = useCallback(async () => {
  const loadedProjects = await StorageService.getProjects();
  setProjects(loadedProjects);
  
  // If current project was updated, refresh it too
  if (currentProject) {
    const updatedCurrentProject = loadedProjects.find(p => p.id === currentProject.id);
    if (updatedCurrentProject) {
      setCurrentProject(updatedCurrentProject);
      console.log('[Panel] Current project refreshed after update');
    }
  }
}, [currentProject]);
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/panel/panel.tsx`

**Modified `loadProjects` function:**
- Added check for `currentProject`
- Find updated project in loaded projects
- Update `currentProject` state with fresh data
- Added dependency on `currentProject` to useCallback

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Edit Current Project Title
1. Open a project
2. Go to Projects tab
3. Click edit on the current project
4. Change title from "My Project" to "Updated Project"
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Go back to Generate tab
7. ✅ Header shows "Updated Project"

### Test Scenario 2: Edit Current Project Description
1. Open a project
2. Go to Projects tab
3. Click edit on the current project
4. Change description
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Go back to Projects tab
7. ✅ Project card shows updated description

### Test Scenario 3: Edit Different Project
1. Open Project A
2. Go to Projects tab
3. Edit Project B (not current)
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. ✅ Project B updates, Project A remains unchanged

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate Feedback:** Changes appear instantly without reload

✅ **Consistent State:** UI always reflects current data

✅ **Better UX:** No confusion about whether changes were saved

✅ **No Page Reload:** Changes sync automatically
