# Mini Bar Button Glitch Fix

## Problem
Mini bar buttons would become unclickable after some time, requiring scrolling or moving to make them clickable again.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Stale event listeners and positioning updates in `usePanelMiniBar`
2. Pointer events not being consistently enforced during position updates
3. Using `onMouseDown` instead of `onClick` for button handlers
4. Missing cleanup and state management in the autoUpdate lifecycle

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced `usePanelMiniBar` Hook
- Added `useCallback` for stable function references
- Added `isUpdatingRef` to prevent race conditions during updates
- Force-set critical styles (`pointerEvents: 'auto'`, `zIndex`) on every position update
- Improved cleanup of autoUpdate subscriptions
- Added passive event listeners for better performance
- Better error handling in position computation

### 2. Improved MiniBar Component
- Changed button handlers from `onMouseDown` to `onClick` for more reliable interaction
- Added explicit `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to all buttons
- Added `userSelect: 'none'` to prevent text selection interference
- Added `onClick` handler to container to ensure event propagation
- Disabled pointer events on buttons when processing to prevent double-clicks

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/usePanelMiniBar.ts` - Enhanced positioning and event handling
- `src/components/MiniBar.tsx` - Improved button interaction reliability

## Testing
Build successful with no TypeScript errors. The mini bar should now:
- Remain clickable at all times
- Handle rapid interactions without glitching
- Properly update position during scroll/resize
- Maintain pointer events through all state changes
