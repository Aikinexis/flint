# Fixes Summary

## 1. Undo/Redo System ✅

**Problem:** Undo/redo didn't work for AI-generated content, only for manual typing.

**Solution:**
- Created custom undo/redo hook (`src/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts`)
- Integrated into `UnifiedEditor` component
- Added `pushToHistory` method to manually push states after AI operations
- AI operations now push to history after streaming completes

**Result:** Undo/redo now works for:
- Manual typing (debounced 300ms)
- AI Generate operations
- AI Rewrite operations
- AI Summarize operations

## 2. Smart Selection for Rewrite/Summarize ✅

**Problem:** Rewrite and Summarize would process the entire document if nothing was selected, which could be accidental.

**Solution:**
- Modified `handleRewrite` in `ToolControlsContainer.tsx` with smart selection behavior
- Modified `handleSummarize` in `ToolControlsContainer.tsx` with smart selection behavior
- **First press with no selection:** Selects all text (visual feedback)
- **Second press with selection:** Runs the AI operation

**Result:** 
- Better UX: Users see what will be processed before it happens
- First press: Select all text (gives user chance to review)
- Second press: Process the selected text
- Prevents accidental processing without user awareness

## 3. Cursor Position After Generate ✅

**Problem:** After Generate operation completed, cursor wasn't positioned at the end of the generated text.

**Solution:**
- Added `textarea.focus()` after streaming completes
- Added `editorRef.current.updateCapturedSelection()` to update internal state
- Applied same fix to Rewrite/Summarize operations

**Result:**
- Cursor is now correctly positioned at end of generated text
- Textarea is focused and ready for continued typing
- Selection is properly tracked in editor state

## Testing

### Undo/Redo
1. Type text → wait 300ms → Cmd+Z → text undone ✅
2. Generate AI text → Cmd+Z → AI text undone ✅
3. Rewrite selection → Cmd+Z → rewrite undone ✅
4. Multiple undo/redo steps work correctly ✅

### Smart Selection
1. Click Rewrite with no selection → selects all text ✅
2. Click Rewrite again → processes the selected text ✅
3. Click Summarize with no selection → selects all text ✅
4. Click Summarize again → processes the selected text ✅
5. Select text manually → Rewrite/Summarize → works immediately ✅

### Cursor Position
1. Generate text → cursor at end of generated text ✅
2. Rewrite text → selection highlights rewritten text ✅
3. Summarize text → selection highlights summary ✅
