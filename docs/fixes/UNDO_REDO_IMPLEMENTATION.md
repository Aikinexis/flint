# Undo/Redo Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

The native browser undo/redo functionality was broken when AI operations programmatically changed the editor content. This implementation provides a custom undo/redo system that works seamlessly with both manual typing and AI-generated content.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `src/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts`
- Custom undo/redo history management
- Tracks content and selection state
- Supports up to 100 history states (configurable)
- Provides `undo()`, `redo()`, `canUndo()`, `canRedo()`, and `clear()` methods

### 2. Updated: `src/components/UnifiedEditor.tsx`
- Integrated custom undo/redo system
- Intercepts `Cmd+Z`/`Ctrl+Z` for undo
- Intercepts `Cmd+Shift+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` for redo
- Debounces manual typing (300ms) to group keystrokes
- Immediately pushes state after AI operations
- Restores both content and selection during undo/redo
- Exposes `undo()`, `redo()`, `canUndo()`, `canRedo()` via ref

### 3. Documentation
- `docs/implementation/undo-redo-system.md` - Technical documentation
- `tests/manual-tests/test-undo-redo.html` - Manual test suite

## How It Works

1. **Manual Typing:**
   - User types in editor
   - After 300ms of inactivity, state is pushed to history
   - Groups rapid keystrokes into single undo operation

2. **AI Operations:**
   - AI generates/rewrites/summarizes text
   - State is immediately pushed to history after operation completes
   - Entire AI operation can be undone as single step

3. **Undo/Redo:**
   - User presses keyboard shortcut
   - Previous/next state is retrieved from history
   - Content and selection are restored
   - Focus returns to editor

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Undo:** `Cmd+Z` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux)
- **Redo:** `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux)

## Testing

Run the manual test suite by opening `tests/manual-tests/test-undo-redo.html` in a browser and following the instructions.

Test scenarios include:
- Manual typing undo/redo
- AI operation undo/redo
- Multiple undo/redo steps
- Redo history clearing
- Selection restoration

## Benefits

✅ Works with both manual and AI-generated changes  
✅ Preserves cursor position and text selection  
✅ Standard keyboard shortcuts  
✅ Intuitive grouping of operations  
✅ No conflicts with native browser undo/redo  

## Build Status

✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**  
✅ ESLint: **PASSED** (no new warnings)  
✅ Build: **PASSED**  

The implementation is ready for testing in the Chrome extension.
