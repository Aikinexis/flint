# Task 66 Implementation: AI Availability Check on Panel Load

## Summary

Successfully implemented AI availability checking on panel load with visual feedback to users when AI features are unavailable or require download.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created AIAvailabilityBanner Component (`src/components/AIAvailabilityBanner.tsx`)

A new React component that displays a banner when AI APIs are unavailable or need download:

**Features:**
- Shows warning banner when any AI API is unavailable
- Shows info banner when APIs need download
- Displays detailed API status breakdown (Prompt, Summarizer, Rewriter)
- Provides links to Chrome AI setup instructions
- Indicates when mock provider will be used
- Automatically hides when all APIs are available
- Fully accessible with ARIA labels and semantic HTML

**Visual Design:**
- Orange theme for unavailable APIs (warning)
- Blue theme for downloadable APIs (info)
- Consistent with Flint's design system
- Responsive and readable

### 2. Integrated Banner into Settings Component (`src/components/Settings.tsx`)

- Imported AIAvailabilityBanner component
- Imported useAppState hook to access AI availability
- Added banner at the top of Settings panel
- Banner receives AI availability status from app state
- Updates automatically when availability changes
- Only displays in Settings tab (per user request)

### 3. Exported Component (`src/components/index.ts`)

- Added AIAvailabilityBanner to component exports
- Exported AIAvailabilityBannerProps interface

### 4. Existing Infrastructure (Already in Place)

The following were already implemented in previous tasks:
- AI availability check in AppProvider on mount
- Availability status stored in app state
- AIService.checkAvailability() method with caching
- State management for AI availability

## Requirements Met

✅ **Requirement 10.1**: Display message when AI is unavailable with link to setup instructions
✅ **Requirement 10.2**: Use mock provider when AI unavailable (indicated in banner)
✅ Call aiService.checkAvailability() on panel mount (already implemented)
✅ Store availability status in app state (already implemented)
✅ Display banner if AI is unavailable
✅ Show link to setup instructions
✅ Update UI to indicate mock provider is being used

## Testing

### Build Verification
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- ESLint: ✅ No errors in new component
- Bundle size: ✅ 332KB (well under 1MB limit)
- Production build: ✅ Successful

### Test File Created
- `test-ai-banner.html`: Visual test for banner component with different availability states

## User Experience

### When AI is Unavailable
Users see:
- Clear warning banner with orange theme
- Message: "AI features require Chrome 128 or later with Gemini Nano enabled"
- Explanation that mock provider will be used
- Link to setup instructions
- Detailed API status breakdown

### When AI Needs Download
Users see:
- Info banner with blue theme
- Message about Gemini Nano model download
- Explanation that download starts automatically
- Link to learn more

### When AI is Available
- No banner shown in Settings
- Clean interface without distractions

### Banner Location
- Banner only appears in the Settings panel
- Does not appear on other tabs (Voice, Rewrite, Summary, History)
- Keeps other panels clean and focused on their primary tasks

## Code Quality

- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Accessible (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Follows Flint design system
- Consistent with existing component patterns
- Well-documented with JSDoc comments
- No console warnings or errors

## Next Steps

This completes Phase 12 of the implementation plan. The next phase (Phase 13) focuses on:
- Task 67: Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- Task 68: Implement keyboard navigation
- Task 69: Verify color contrast and accessibility
- Task 70: Add animations and micro-interactions
- Task 71: Optimize bundle size
- Task 72: Add performance monitoring
