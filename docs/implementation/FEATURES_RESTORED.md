- ‚ùå Limited to viewing brief previews

### After (Enhanced HistoryPanel)
- ‚úÖ Quick search through all snapshots
- ‚úÖ Filter by operation type
- ‚úÖ Flexible sorting options
- ‚úÖ Like important versions for quick access

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These features from the old History component were not restored (lower priority):

1. **Detailed View Modal** - Full content view before restoring
   - Workaround: Restore snapshot to see full content
   
2. **Clear All History** - Bulk delete snapshots
   - Workaround: Delete project to remove all snapshots
   
3. **Copy to Clipboard** - Quick copy of snapshot content
   - Workaround: Restore snapshot and copy from editor

4. **Export History** - Download snapshots as file
   - Not in original component, but could be useful

## Migration Notes

- All existing snapshots remain unchanged
- The `liked` field defaults to `undefined` (falsy) for existing snapshots
- No data migration needed
- Backward compatible with existing storage

## Conclusion

The HistoryPanel now has feature parity with the most important functionality from the old History component, while maintaining the new unified editor workflow design. Users can effectively search, filter, sort, and organize their version history.
