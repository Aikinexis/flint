# Flint - Branding & Extension ID Guide

## Understanding Chrome Extension IDs

### What is the Extension ID?

The extension ID (`occpmnpeaaiobnkkgkcmbgcigocnpcjh`) is a **cryptographic hash** automatically generated by Chrome based on your extension's private key. It **cannot be customized** or changed to a readable name.

### Why Can't I Change It?

Chrome uses this ID to:
1. Uniquely identify your extension
2. Maintain security and prevent spoofing
3. Track updates and versions
4. Manage permissions and storage

### When Does It Change?

The ID only changes if you:
1. Delete and recreate the extension from scratch
2. Generate a new private key
3. Publish to Chrome Web Store (gets a new stable ID)

**Important**: Once published to Chrome Web Store, the ID becomes permanent and tied to your developer account.

## What You CAN Customize

### 1. Extension Name ✅

**Full Name** (shown in Chrome extensions page):
```json
"name": "Flint - Local AI Writing Assistant"
```

**Short Name** (shown in limited space):
```json
"short_name": "Flint"
```

### 2. Description ✅

```json
"description": "AI-powered writing assistant with voice-to-text, smart rewriting, and text summarization. 100% local, private, and fast using Chrome's built-in AI."

    "suggested_key": {
      "default": "Ctrl+Shift+F",
      "mac": "Command+Shift+F"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Icons ✅

Create custom icons in `public/icons/`:
- `icon16.png` - Toolbar icon
- `icon48.png` - Extensions page
