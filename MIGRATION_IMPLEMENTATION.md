# History to Snapshots Migration Implementation

## Overview

Task 19 has been successfully implemented. The migration system converts existing history items from the old format to the new snapshot-based system, creating a default project to house the migrated data.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Storage Service Updates (`src/services/storage.ts`)

#### Settings Interface Extension
- Added `historyMigrated?: boolean` flag to the `Settings` interface
- This flag tracks whether migration has been completed to prevent duplicate migrations

#### Migration Functions

**`migrateHistoryToSnapshots()`**
- Main migration function that handles the conversion process
- Returns a result object with success status, migrated count, and optional project ID
- Process:
  1. Checks if migration already completed (via settings flag)
  2. Retrieves all existing history items
  3. Creates a default project titled "Migrated History" if items exist
  4. Converts each history item to snapshot format:
     - Generates appropriate action descriptions based on type and metadata
     - Preserves timestamps from original history items
     - Links all snapshots to the default project
  5. Marks migration as complete in settings
  6. Handles errors gracefully, continuing with remaining items if one fails

**`checkAndMigrateHistory()`**
- Convenience function for app initialization
- Checks migration status and runs migration if needed
- Non-blocking: logs errors but doesn't throw to prevent app startup issues

### 2. Panel Integration (`src/panel/panel.tsx`)

Added a new `useEffect` hook that:
- Runs on component mount (empty dependency array)
- Calls `StorageService.checkAndMigrateHistory()`
- Reloads projects list after migration to show the new default project
- Handles errors gracefully without blocking app initialization

### 3. Action Description Generation

The migration intelligently generates human-readable descriptions based on history item metadata:

- **Generate**: "Generated text"
- **Rewrite**: 
  - With preset: "Rewrote with {preset} preset" (e.g., "Rewrote with formal preset")
  - Without preset: "Rewrote text"
- **Summarize**:
  - With mode: "Summarized as {mode}" (e.g., "Summarized as key-points")
  - Without mode: "Summarized text"

### 4. Data Preservation

The migration preserves:
- ✅ Original content (stored in snapshot.content as resultText)
- ✅ Operation type (generate/rewrite/summarize)
- ✅ Timestamps (exact timestamp from history item)
- ✅ Metadata context (converted to action descriptions)

Not preserved (by design):
- ❌ Original input text (only result text is kept)
- ❌ Selection ranges (not available in old format)

## Testing

A test page (`test-migration.html`) has been created to verify the migration:

### Test Functions
1. **Create Test History Items** - Generates sample history data
2. **Run Migration** - Executes the migration process
3. **Check Migration Status** - Verifies the migration flag
4. **View Projects** - Lists all projects including migrated one
5. **View Snapshots** - Shows snapshots in each project
6. **View Old History** - Displays remaining history items
7. **Clear All Test Data** - Resets everything for retesting

### Usage
1. Open `test-migration.html` in a browser
2. Click "Create Test History Items" to generate sample data
3. Click "Run Migration" to execute the migration
4. Use "View Projects" and "View Snapshots" to verify results
5. Check that migration status shows "COMPLETED"

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **8.1** - Create migration function in storage service  
✅ **8.2** - Read existing history items from old storage  
✅ **8.3** - Convert to Snapshot format  
✅ **8.4** - Create default project for orphaned history  
✅ **8.5** - Save snapshots to new storage  
✅ **8.6** - Mark migration as complete in settings  

## Migration Behavior

### First Run
- Checks for existing history items
- Creates "Migrated History" project if items exist
- Converts all history items to snapshots
- Sets `historyMigrated: true` in settings

### Subsequent Runs
- Immediately returns if `historyMigrated` flag is true
- No duplicate migrations occur
- No performance impact on app startup

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ No history items: Marks migration complete without creating project
- ✅ Already migrated: Skips migration immediately
- ✅ Individual item failure: Continues with remaining items
- ✅ Complete migration failure: Logs error but doesn't block app

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

Build output:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Vite build: Successful
- ✅ Bundle size: 310.67 kB (within limits)
- ✅ No diagnostics or warnings

## Next Steps

The migration is now complete and integrated. The next task (Task 20) will:
- Remove the History tab from sidebar navigation
- Remove the old History component
- Clean up old history storage methods
- Keep Settings tab unchanged

## Notes

- Migration runs automatically on first app load after this update
- Users will see a new "Migrated History" project if they had existing history
- The old history data remains in storage (will be cleaned up in Task 20)
- Migration is idempotent - safe to run multiple times
