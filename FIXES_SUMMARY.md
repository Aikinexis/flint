# Fixes Summary - Auto-Title & Placeholder Removal

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Auto-Title Generation Now Works
**Problem:** Title stayed "Untitled Project" even after AI generation

**Root Cause:** 
- Was checking `editorContent` BEFORE AI result was added
- Only checked for "Untitled" not "Untitled Project"

**Solution:**
- Moved auto-title logic to AFTER content is updated (in streaming callback)
- Now checks for both "Untitled" AND "Untitled Project"
- Added 500ms delay to ensure content is fully updated
- Works for Generate, Rewrite, AND Summarize operations

**How It Works Now:**
```
User generates text in empty project
    ↓
AI generates: "Subject: Leave Request\n\nDear [Boss's Name]..."
    ↓
Content is updated in editor
    ↓
500ms delay
    ↓
generateSmartTitle() analyzes content
    ↓
Finds "Subject: Leave Request"
    ↓
Updates project title to "Leave Request"
    ↓
Project list refreshes automatically
```

### 2. ✅ Placeholder Text Removal
**Problem:** AI was generating placeholder text like `[Boss's Name]`, `[Start Date]`, `[End Date]`, `[Your Name]`

**Solution:** Added strict rules to AI prompts:
```
CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT use ellipsis (...) or placeholder text like [Name], [Date], [Company], etc.
- NEVER use square brackets [] for placeholders - write actual content or leave blank
```

**Applied to:**
- Generate with context
- Generate without context
- All document types (email, letter, article, etc.)

## Testing Checklist

### Auto-Title Generation

- General: First 50 chars

### Placeholder Removal
- [ ] Generate email content
- [ ] Check for NO `[Name]`, `[Date]`, `[Company]` placeholders
- [ ] Content should be actual text or blank spaces
