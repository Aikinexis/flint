# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical usability issue in the Unified Editor where text selection and cursor position are lost when users click on AI tool buttons. This prevents users from performing AI operations because the system cannot determine what text to process or where to insert generated content. The solution must preserve selection and cursor state across focus changes while maintaining a clean, intuitive user experience.

## Glossary

- **Unified Editor**: The single shared textarea component used across all tool tabs
- **Selection State**: The start and end positions of highlighted text in the textarea
- **Cursor Position**: The insertion point (caret) position when no text is selected
- **Focus Loss**: When the textarea loses keyboard focus due to clicking outside it
- **Captured State**: Selection or cursor position stored in memory before focus loss
- **Tool Controls**: The buttons and inputs below the editor (Generate, Rewrite, Summarize)
- **Mini Bar**: The floating toolbar that appears above selected text

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Selection State Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my text selection to remain highlighted when I click AI tool buttons, so that I can see what text will be processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects text in the Unified Editor, THE System SHALL capture and store the selection range (start and end positions) in a ref
2. WHEN the user clicks a button in the Tool Controls or Mini Bar, THE System SHALL preserve the captured selection range even though the textarea loses focus
3. WHEN an AI operation executes, THE System SHALL use the captured selection range to determine which text to process
4. THE System SHALL maintain visual selection highlighting in the textarea even after focus loss (using CSS or programmatic selection restoration)
5. IF the user clicks back into the textarea without changing selection, THE System SHALL restore the exact same selection range

### Requirement 2: Cursor Position Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my cursor position to be remembered when I click the Generate button, so that generated text appears at the correct location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user positions the cursor in the Unified Editor (with no text selected), THE System SHALL capture and store the cursor position in a ref
2. WHEN the user clicks the Generate button, THE System SHALL preserve the captured cursor position even though the textarea loses focus
3. WHEN the Generate operation completes, THE System SHALL insert the generated text at the captured cursor position
4. THE System SHALL show the cursor indicator at the correct position when the Generate button is clicked
5. IF the user clicks back into the textarea, THE System SHALL restore the cursor to the captured position

### Requirement 3: Focus Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editor to automatically regain focus after AI operations complete, so that I can continue editing immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. AFTER an AI operation completes and text is replaced inline, THE System SHALL restore focus to the Unified Editor textarea
2. THE System SHALL set the selection to highlight the newly inserted or replaced text
3. IF the operation was a Generate operation, THE System SHALL position the cursor at the end of the inserted text
4. THE System SHALL ensure focus restoration happens smoothly without jarring visual jumps
5. THE System SHALL maintain keyboard accessibility throughout the focus management flow

### Requirement 4: Mini Bar Selection Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Mini Bar to work reliably with my text selection, so that I can quickly apply AI operations without losing my place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Mini Bar appears on text selection, THE System SHALL capture the selection range before any button clicks
2. WHEN the user clicks a Mini Bar button, THE System SHALL use the captured selection range (not the current selection which may be empty)
3. AFTER the Mini Bar operation completes, THE System SHALL restore the selection to highlight the replaced text
4. THE Mini Bar SHALL remain visible during the AI operation to provide visual continuity
5. THE System SHALL hide the Mini Bar only after the operation completes and focus is restored

### Requirement 5: Tool Controls Selection Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Rewrite and Summarize buttons to work with my selected text, so that I can apply operations without re-selecting text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Rewrite Selection" button, THE System SHALL use the captured selection range to determine which text to rewrite
2. WHEN the user clicks the "Summarize Selection" button, THE System SHALL use the captured selection range to determine which text to summarize
3. IF no text is selected when these buttons are clicked, THE System SHALL show an error message prompting the user to select text first
4. THE System SHALL validate that the captured selection range is still valid (within current content bounds)
5. AFTER the operation completes, THE System SHALL restore the selection to highlight the replaced text

### Requirement 6: Generate Button Cursor Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Generate button to insert text at my cursor position, so that I can build my document incrementally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Generate" button, THE System SHALL use the captured cursor position to determine where to insert text
2. THE System SHALL show the cursor indicator at the captured position when the Generate button is clicked
3. IF the cursor position is invalid (beyond content length), THE System SHALL default to inserting at the end of the content
4. AFTER the Generate operation completes, THE System SHALL position the cursor at the end of the inserted text
5. THE System SHALL hide the cursor indicator after the operation completes

### Requirement 7: State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the selection and cursor state to be synchronized across all components, so that the system behaves consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Unified Editor SHALL expose a ref with methods to get the current selection range and cursor position
2. THE Tool Controls container SHALL access the captured state from the Unified Editor ref
3. THE Mini Bar SHALL receive the captured selection range as a prop from the Unified Editor
4. THE System SHALL update the captured state whenever the user changes selection or cursor position in the textarea
5. THE System SHALL clear the captured state only when the user makes a new selection or positions the cursor at a different location

### Requirement 8: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when operations fail due to invalid selection or cursor state, so that I understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF an AI operation is triggered with no captured selection or cursor position, THE System SHALL show an error message: "Please select text or position your cursor first"
2. IF the captured selection range is invalid (start > end or beyond content bounds), THE System SHALL show an error message: "Selection is no longer valid. Please select text again"
3. IF the captured cursor position is invalid (negative or beyond content bounds), THE System SHALL default to the end of the content and log a warning
4. THE System SHALL not execute AI operations when the captured state is invalid
5. THE System SHALL provide a way to manually refresh the captured state (e.g., clicking back into the textarea)

### Requirement 9: Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual indicators that show my selection and cursor state are preserved, so that I feel confident the operation will work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL maintain the visual selection highlight in the textarea even after focus loss (using CSS :focus-within or programmatic selection)
2. THE System SHALL show the cursor indicator when the Generate button is clicked, confirming the insertion point
3. THE System SHALL show the selection highlight indicator when Rewrite or Summarize buttons are clicked, confirming the text to be processed
4. THE System SHALL provide a brief animation or highlight when text is replaced inline, confirming the operation completed
5. THE System SHALL ensure all visual indicators are accessible and meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the selection persistence changes to integrate seamlessly with existing code, so that no other features break.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL maintain all existing Unified Editor functionality (content changes, tab switching, etc.)
2. THE System SHALL not break existing Mini Bar positioning or auto-hide behavior
3. THE System SHALL not break existing Tool Controls functionality (presets, options, etc.)
4. THE System SHALL not break existing inline replacement logic
5. THE System SHALL pass all existing tests (if any) and not introduce regressions
