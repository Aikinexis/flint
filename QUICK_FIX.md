# Quick Fix Guide

## What I See in Your Screenshot

✅ **Textarea IS working** - You typed "ssssss"
✅ **Layout is correct** - Sidebar on right, content in middle
✅ **Generate tab is active** - Blue sparkles icon
✅ **Input field visible** - "Start writing..." placeholder

## Likely Issues

### 1. Button Not Clickable
The sparkles button (✨) might have a z-index or pointer-events issue.

**Quick Test:**
1. Type a prompt in the bottom input: "write a short poem"
2. Press ENTER key (don't click the button)
3. Check if it works

### 2. AI Service Not Enabled
Chrome's built-in AI might not be enabled.

**Quick Fix:**
1. Go to: `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
2. Set to "Enabled BypassPerfRequirement"
3. Go to: `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
4. Set to "Enabled"
5. Restart Chrome
6. Wait 5 minutes for model download

### 3. User Activation Error
AI APIs require a user click. First click might fail.

**Quick Fix:**
- Click the button TWICE
- First click activates, second click executes

## Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Check Console
1. Open DevTools: F12
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type something in the input
4. Click the sparkles button
5. Look for error messages

### Step 2: Try Keyboard Shortcut
1. Click in the bottom input field
2. Type: "test"
3. Press ENTER
4. See if it triggers

### Step 3: Check Button State
1. Inspect the sparkles button (right-click > Inspect)
2. Check if it has `disabled` attribute
3. Check if `pointer-events: none` in styles

## Expected Console Output

When you click Generate, you should see:
```
[ToolControlsContainer] Generating...
[AI] Checking availability...
[AI] Availability check: {promptAPI: "available", ...}
[AI] Generating with Writer API...
[Panel] generate operation completed
```

## If You See Errors

### Error: "User activation required"
**Solution:** Click the button again immediately

### Error: "AI features require Chrome 128+"
**Solution:** Update Chrome or enable flags (see above)

### Error: "Please enter a prompt"
**Solution:** The input field is empty - type something first

### Error: "Failed to fetch" or "Network error"
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen (local AI), check console

## Nuclear Option: Reset Everything

If nothing works:
```bash
# 1. Clean build
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build

# 2. Reload extension
# Go to chrome://extensions/
# Click reload button

# 3. Close and reopen side panel
```

## What Should Definitely Work

Even if AI is not enabled, these should work:
- ✅ Typing in textarea
- ✅ Switching tabs
- ✅ Projects button opens modal
- ✅ Settings tab opens

If these DON'T work, there's a JavaScript error. Check console!

## Send Me This Info

If it still doesn't work, send me:
1. Chrome version (chrome://version/)
2. Console errors (screenshot or copy/paste)
3. What happens when you click the button
4. What happens when you press ENTER in the input

## Most Likely Cause

Based on your screenshot, I think:
1. You haven't enabled Chrome's AI flags yet
2. OR the button needs to be clicked twice (user activation)
3. OR there's a console error we need to see

The code is correct and the build is successful. It's likely a configuration or runtime issue, not a code issue.
