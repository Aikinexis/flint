# Version Carousel Implementation

## Overview

Replaced the separate input/output card UI with a unified carousel-based interface that allows users to navigate between multiple versions of text (original + AI-generated variations).

## Key Changes

### New Component: `VersionCarousel.tsx`

A reusable carousel component that displays text versions with:

- **Always-editable textarea**: Text is always editable without needing an edit button
- **Clean design**: Transparent background, no grey cards
- **Bottom navigation**: All controls at the bottom of the card
- **Navigation arrows**: Left/right arrows on either side of the dots
- **Version indicators**: Dots in the center showing current position
- **Like/Unlike**: Heart icon to favorite versions (marked in history)
- **Delete**: Remove AI-generated versions (original cannot be deleted)
- **Loading state**: Shows overlay spinner during AI processing

### Updated Components

#### `RewritePanel.tsx`
- Removed separate input textarea and CompareView navigation
- Integrated VersionCarousel for displaying original + rewritten versions
- Each "Rewrite" click creates a new version that slides in from the right
- Users can navigate between all versions using arrows
- Versions are labeled: "Original", "Version 1", "Version 2", etc.

#### `SummaryPanel.tsx`
- Removed separate input textarea and summary result card
- Integrated VersionCarousel for displaying original + summary versions
- Each "Summarize" click creates a new version
- Copy button now copies the currently visible version
- Versions are labeled: "Original", "Summary 1", "Summary 2", etc.

## User Flow

1. **Initial state**: User sees empty carousel with placeholder text
2. **Input text**: Type or paste directly into the always-editable textarea
3. **Generate AI output**: Click "Rewrite" or "Summarize" button (below the carousel)
4. **New version appears**: Carousel automatically navigates to the new version
5. **Navigate versions**: Use left/right arrows or dots at the bottom to view different versions
6. **Edit any version**: All text is always editable - just click and type
7. **Like versions**: Click heart icon at bottom-right to mark favorites
8. **Delete versions**: Click trash icon at bottom-right to remove AI-generated versions
9. **Generate more**: Create additional versions from any existing version

## Features

- **Always editable**: No edit mode - text is always ready to modify
- **Clean interface**: Transparent background, minimal chrome, focus on content
- **Bottom controls**: All navigation and actions consolidated at the bottom
- **Smooth navigation**: Arrow buttons and dot indicators for easy version switching
- **Version management**: Like and delete functionality for organizing outputs
- **Visual feedback**: Dots show position in version history
- **Responsive design**: Carousel adapts to content with scrollable text area
- **Action buttons below**: Rewrite/Summarize buttons stay at the bottom of the panel

## Technical Details

- **State management**: Each panel maintains its own version array and current index
- **Version structure**: Each version has id, text, label, isOriginal, isLiked, timestamp
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: Efficient re-renders with React state management

## Bundle Size

Build output remains under 1MB compressed:
- panel.js: 257.16 kB (69.36 kB gzipped)
- Total bundle well within constraints
