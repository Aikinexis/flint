# Flint Chrome Extension

Voice-to-text, summarization, and rewriting with local AI for Chrome.

## Overview

Flint is a Chrome extension that provides a unified writing environment with AI-powered text generation, rewriting, and summarization. Built on Chrome's local AI APIs, all text processing happens on your device for complete privacy.

## Features

### Unified Editor Workflow
- **Single Persistent Editor**: Work in one document across all AI tools
- **Inline AI Operations**: Generate, rewrite, and summarize text directly in your editor
- **Project Management**: Organize multiple writing projects (emails, blog posts, notes)
- **Version History**: Track changes with automatic snapshots after each AI operation
- **Context-Aware Generation**: AI understands surrounding text for natural continuity

### AI Capabilities
- **Generate**: Create text from prompts with context awareness
- **Rewrite**: Transform text with presets (formal, casual, concise, expand) or custom instructions
- **Summarize**: Extract key points, create paragraphs, or generate outlines
- **Proofread**: Fix spelling and grammar errors

### Performance
- **Local-First**: All AI processing happens on your device using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano
- **No External Servers**: No accounts, no tracking, no data leaves your browser
- **Fast & Responsive**: Instant AI operations with no network latency

## Key Features

### Unified Editor  
Work in a single persistent editor across all AI tools. No more switching between panels or losing your place.  

### Inline Operations  
AI results appear directly in your editor with no compare views or extra steps. Select text, apply AI, and youâ€™re done.  

### Project Management  
Organize multiple writing projects. Each project maintains its own content and version history.  

### Version Snapshots  
Every AI operation creates an automatic snapshot. Review changes, restore previous versions, or track your writing progress.  

### Context-Aware AI  
Generate text that flows naturally with what youâ€™ve already written. The AI understands surrounding context for better continuity.  

### Pinned Notes  
Add audience descriptions or style guidelines that influence all AI operations. Ideal for maintaining a consistent tone.

## How to Use

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start Writing**: Type or paste text into the editor
2. **Select a Tool**: Choose Generate, Rewrite, or Summarize from the sidebar
3. **Configure Options**: Set tone, length, or provide custom instructions
4. **Execute**: Click the action button - results appear inline in your editor
5. **Iterate**: Make multiple changes - each creates a version snapshot

### Generate Text
- Position cursor where you want new text
- Enter a prompt or leave empty for continuation
- AI generates text that flows naturally with surrounding content
- Generated text appears at cursor position

### Rewrite Text
- Select text you want to transform
- Choose a preset (formal, casual, concise, expand) or write custom instructions
- AI rewrites selected text in place
- Original text is preserved in version history

### Summarize Text
- Select text to summarize
- Choose format: bullets, paragraph, or brief
- Summary replaces selected text
- Adjust reading level for your audience

### Project Management
- Click "Projects" button to view all projects
- Create new projects for different writing tasks
- Switch between projects - content auto-saves
- Each project has its own version history

### Version History
- Click history toggle (â€¹/â€º) to open snapshot panel
- View all changes made to current project
- Click any snapshot to restore that version
- Snapshots show action type and timestamp

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will rebuild automatically when you make changes.

## Architecture

### Unified Editor Workflow

Flint uses a single persistent editor that works across all AI tools:

1. **Editor Component**: Shared textarea with selection tracking and cursor indicators
2. **Tool Controls**: Context-specific options (Generate, Rewrite, Summarize) below editor
3. **Inline Operations**: AI results replace text directly in the editor
4. **Automatic Snapshots**: Each AI operation creates a version snapshot
5. **Version History**: Collapsible panel shows all snapshots for current project

### Chrome Built-in AI APIs

Flint leverages Chrome's local AI with intelligent fallbacks:

**Writer API**: Context-aware text generation
```typescript
const writer = await Writer.create({
  tone: 'neutral',
  format: 'plain-text',
  length: 'medium',
  sharedContext: pinnedNotes.join('\n')
});
const result = await writer.write(prompt);
```

**Rewriter API**: Text transformation with tone control
```typescript
const rewriter = await Rewriter.create({
  tone: 'more-formal',
  format: 'plain-text',
  length: 'as-is'
});
const result = await rewriter.rewrite(selectedText);
```

**Summarizer API**: Text summarization with options
```typescript
const summarizer = await Summarizer.create({
  type: 'key-points',
  format: 'markdown',
  length: 'medium'
});
const summary = await summarizer.summarize(selectedText);
```

**Prompt API**: Fallback for custom instructions
```typescript
const session = await ai.languageModel.create();
const result = await session.prompt(customPrompt);
```

All APIs include:
- Availability checks before use
- User activation requirements (click/keypress)
- Graceful fallbacks to mock providers
- Timeout protection (30 seconds)

## Permissions

**Required permissions:**
- `storage` - Persist settings, projects, and version snapshots locally
- `sidePanel` - Display side panel UI for the unified editor
- `scripting` - Inject content scripts for web page text manipulation (future feature)
- `activeTab` - Access current tab for text operations (future feature)

**Optional permissions:**
- `audioCapture` - Microphone access for voice recording (not yet implemented)

**Storage:**
- IndexedDB for projects and version snapshots (unlimited storage)
- chrome.storage.local for settings and preferences (limited to 10 MB)
- All data stored locally - nothing sent to external servers

**Privacy:**
- No external network calls for AI operations (all local)
- No user tracking or analytics
- No accounts or authentication required
- Web Speech API may use server-based recognition (optional feature)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working

If you see "AI features require Chrome 128 or later with Gemini Nano enabled":

1. Update Chrome to version 128 or later
2. Enable Gemini Nano:
   - Go to `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
   - Set to "Enabled BypassPerfRequirement"
   - Go to `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
   - Set to "Enabled"
   - Restart Chrome
3. Wait for the model to download (may take a few minutes)

### Microphone Not Working

If voice capture doesn't work:

1. Check that Chrome has microphone permission
2. Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
3. Ensure the site or extension has access
4. Check your system microphone settings
